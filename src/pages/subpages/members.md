      The distinction of Honorary Membership within Alpha Lambda Mu is granted
      under closely-reviewed circumstances by the Board of Trustees and National
      Shura. Honorary Membership is a means of extending the privilege of
      membership unto leaders of great character who are not enrolled as
      students at a campus where ALM has an active chapter or colony. Honorary
      Members enjoy all the rights afforded alumni members of the chapter into
      which they are initiated.
